    I am currently a <span class="decorate">student at QUTðŸŽ“</span>. 
    After majoring in biology, I worked at a ðŸ§¬sequencing company where I developed an interest in <span class="decorate">data analysis</span>, which led me to start an IT developer course. 
    I have acquired skills in both frontend and backend development and am interested in building web applications with a focus on user experience. 
    I am currently utilizing <span class="decorate">data analysis tools (Python)</span> and <span class="decorate">web development technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)</span> to solve problems and optimize based on data.
    My goal is to integrate data analysis and web development to build efficient web applications and provide business insights through data.
